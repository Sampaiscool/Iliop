Cards have different types, and effects

You have a starting hand of 4

Each turn you have 3 mana to spend

You have a corrupted status: It goes up by 1 for each card you play in 1 turn; if its 3 or higher all cards in your hand transform (check if it works for enemies too)

Enemies have simple attacks

Start of each turn you regain all your mana and 4 new cards
